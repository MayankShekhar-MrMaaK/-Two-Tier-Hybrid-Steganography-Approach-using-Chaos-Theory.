The proposed system is a 2 Tier Security System, in which first the messages is encoded in image and then the image is shuffled to provide a higher level of security of images. Eavesdrop cannot cryptanalysis the cipher image. Here, the security relies on a secret key along with the image encryption technique. Chaos is known for randomness, so it is highly secured. Confusion has been done by pixel movement form actual position to a new position and diffusion has been done through byte sequence generated through Henon map. So both the processes of increasing confusion and diffusion resulted in increasing the security of cryptosystem.
